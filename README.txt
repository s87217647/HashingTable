I did not use SongEntry and find as the object, method. Because boil down the difference, we are testing time complexity
difference of findPos() that implement QP and Linear Searching. I used int and contains, it hit the core of what we are trying
to bench marking. So I will say for the benchmarking purpose, it's good enough.
Analysis the result:
The graph is quite illustrative. QP saves a great deal of time compared to linear searching. But linear searching should be
Q(n) = n. I did not get that result, I don't know why.
